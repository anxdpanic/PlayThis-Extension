#### Google Chrome extension for PlayThis add-on

**Requirements:**

* PlayThis 2.x.x
* Kodi setting: _Settings -> Services -> Remote Control -> Allow remote control by programs on other systems_

Adds 'send-to PlayThis' contextmenu item to pages, frames, links, videos and selections.

Uses Kodi JSON-RPC over websockets to remotely execute the PlayThis addon with url/src. PlayThis will attempt to resolve the url with UrlResolver and start playback if possible.
