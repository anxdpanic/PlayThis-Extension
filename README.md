#PlayThis (Firefox)

Adds PlayThis context menu item to pages, frames, links, videos, audio, images and selections.

- 'Send' urls to PlayThis add-on in Kodi for resolving/playback
- 'Add' urls for resolving/playback at a later time
- 'Send as text to Kodi' to send urls/text to Kodi input
- Supports up to 4 remote Kodi profiles

Uses Kodi JSON-RPC over web sockets to remotely execute the PlayThis add-on with url/src.

The PlayThis add-on in Kodi will attempt to resolve the url with UrlResolver, start playback if possible and keep a history of urls.
